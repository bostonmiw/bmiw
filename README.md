# Boston Medical Imaging Workshop website

Developed using `React.js`.

## How to

Install the `npm` package manager:

```console
$ sudo apt install npm
```

Develop. Local changes can be verified running:

```console
$ npm start
```

Once the feature at issue has been verified, push the code to a new branch
following the regular `git` collaborative model so that it can be merged into
`main`.

Once the feature merged into `main`, deploy the website to GitHub pages using:

```console
$ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
```
